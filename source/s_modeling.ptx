        <title>Modeling with first-order differential equations</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Many applications present information about a quantity in a form that can be modeled by a first-order differential equation.
          Here is an outline of the steps to take in these settings.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Explicitly identify the quantity <m>Q</m> under consideration as a function of some other quantity <m>x</m>,
                and give a name to this function: <m>Q=f(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Translate the given information about <m>Q</m> into a
                first-order differential equation:
                <men xml:id="eq_modeling">
                  f'(x)=F(x, f(x)) 
                </men>.
                This is often the trickiest step!
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Look for phrases that indicate rate of change of <m>Q</m> and translate these into equalities involving <m>f'</m>. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When there is a combination of components to the rate of change,
                a diagram may be useful.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Translate phrases like
                <q><m>Q_1</m> is proportional to <m>Q_2</m></q>
                as
                <m>Q_1=k\cdot Q_2</m>, where <m>k</m> is the
                (possibly undetermined)
                constant of proportionality.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Ask yourself whether the differential equation <xref ref="eq_modeling"/> is
                linear or separable. If so, use the appropriate technique to solve it in as general a form as you can.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If the equation is both separable and linear, you can use either method. It is often quicker to use the separation of variables technique. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If the differential equation is linear,
                            make sure to bring it into standard form before using the integrating factor method.  
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
               
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Once you have solved <xref ref="eq_modeling"/> you will have a formula for <m>Q=f(x)</m> that includes some undetermined constants.
                If possible, use any additional information given about <m>Q</m> to determine these undetermined constants.

        <title>Freefall model</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Dudley is dropped out of a plane and falls vertically toward the earth.
                Dudley's acceleration is the sum of two components:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      a downward acceleration due to gravity equal to <m>g\approx 9.8\text{ kg } \cdot \text{m} /\text{s} ^2</m>;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      an acceleration in the opposite direction to Dudley's current velocity,
                      and proportional to <em>the square</em> of this velocity.
