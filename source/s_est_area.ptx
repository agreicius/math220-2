    <title>Estimating area</title>
    <p>
        By way of motivation of what will be the definition of the integral, we consider the computational problem of computing the area of a region defined by the graph of a function.

        <p>
            Let <m>\mathcal{R}</m> be the set of points lying between the graph of <m>f(x)=1-x^3</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=1</m>: that is, 
            <me>
                \mathcal{R}=\{(x,y)\colon 0\leq x\leq 1, 0\leq y\leq f(x) \}
            </me>.
            We will estimate the area of this region by approximating the region itself with a collection of blocks of equal width, whose heights are determined by the <m>y</m>-values of points on the graph of <m>f</m> through some means. The GeoGebra interactive below helps illustrate the technique.

        <title>Estimating area</title>
        <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>f</m> be a nonnegative function defined on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
            and let <m>\mathcal{C}</m> be the graph of <m>f</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.
            To estimate the area between
            <m>\mathcal{C}</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis proceed as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Divide <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> equal subintervals,
                  each of width <m>\Delta x=(b-a)/n</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  For each subinterval pick a <term>sample
                  input</term> <m>x^*</m> in that interval and build the rectangle whose base is the subinterval and whose <term>sample height</term> is given by <m>h=f(x^*)</m>.
                  The area of this block is
                  <men xml:id="eq_area">
                    A=\underset{\text{ height } }{\underbrace{f(x^*)}}\,\underset{\text{ width } }{\underbrace{\Delta x}}
                  </men>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Sum together the areas of the <m>n</m> blocks constructed in
                  Step 2.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on how the sample inputs <m>x^*</m> are chosen in each subinterval,
            we get a different estimate.
            Below you find a number of common methods.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>x^*</m> is chosen as the left (resp. right) endpoint of each subinterval,
                  the estimate is called a <term>left sum estimate</term>
                  (resp.
                  <term>right sum estimate</term>).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>x^*</m> is chosen as the midpoint of each subinterval,
                  the estimate is called a <term>midpoint sum estimate</term>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>x^*</m> is chosen so that <m>f(x^*)</m> is the minimum value of <m>f</m> on each subinterval,
                  the estimate is called a <term>lower sum estimate</term>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>x^*</m> is chosen so that <m>f(x^*)</m> is the maximum value of <m>f</m> on each subinterval,
                  the estimate is called an <term>upper sum estimate</term>.
                </p>

    <algorithm xml:id="proc_est_net_change">
        <title>Estimating net change</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
              Suppose physical quantity <m>Q=g(x)</m> is a function of an input <m>x</m>,
              and that <m>f(x)</m> is the <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>
              of <m>Q</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
            </p>
            <p>Suppose we are only given the rate of change function <m>f</m> and wish to use this to estimate the <term>net change</term> of <m>Q</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>: that is, we wish to estimate <m>\Delta Q=g(b)-g(a)</m>. We can do so using the same method described in <xref ref="proc_est_area"/>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In this context we interpret a sample value <m>r^*=f(x^*)</m> as a
              constant rate of change
              over the given subinterval,
              in which case an individual term
              <me>
                f(x^*)\, \Delta x=r^* \Delta x
              </me>
              in our sum is understood as an estimate of the net change of <m>Q</m> over the given subinterval, under the simplifying assumption that <m>Q</m> changes with
              <em>constant rate of change</em> 
              <m>r^*=f(x^*)</m> over the interval.

    <remark>
        <p>
            Recall that given a function <m>g</m>, its instantaneous rate of change with respect to <m>x</m> is precisely its derivative <m>g'</m>. This allows us to interpret <xref ref="proc_est_net_change"/> as a method of estimating the net change in a function <m>g</m> over an interval using information only about its derivative function <m>f=g'</m>.

            Below you find the graph of the velocity <m>v(t)</m>

            of a driver heading due east <m>t</m> minutes after setting off.
