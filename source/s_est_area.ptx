    <title>Estimating area</title>
    <p>
        By way of motivation of what will be the definition of the integral, we consider the computational problem of computing the area of a region defined by the graph of a function.

        <p>
            Let <m>\mathcal{R}</m> be the set of points lying between the graph of <m>f(x)=1-x^3</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=1</m>: that is, 
            <me>
                \mathcal{R}=\{(x,y)\colon 0\leq x\leq 1, 0\leq y\leq f(x) \}
            </me>.
            We will estimate the area of this region by approximating the region itself with a collection of blocks of equal width, whose heights are determined by the <m>y</m>-values of points on the graph of <m>f</m> through some means. The GeoGebra interactive below helps illustrate the technique.
